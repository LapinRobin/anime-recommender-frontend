Have you been crying?

Harken! These walls are

You don't even remember why?

Might want have
your dad look into that.

33
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,792
Right, 'cause tearing up
is usually a medical thing.

Hey Mr. Hannes.

00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,167
Or you just get
on Mikasa's bad side?

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,292
No! What are you
even talking about?

Ugh! You smell like a tavern!

00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,500

tears were cups of ale.

00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,042
Of course.

Aren't you, uh, on watch?

Yup! Watchin' the
ol' gate we are.

Thirsty work, playin' sentry.
Pinochle only goes so far to

00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,292

Perks of being a guard, eh?

00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,333
How do you expect to fight if
you're so loose on your feet?

48
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:03,333
Huh? Now why on earth
would I have to fight?

00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,958
Why do you think? What if
they break through the walls?

[laugh] The doc's kid
has some fire in him!

54
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,667
Listen, the only thing they've
done to the wall in the past

55
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,542
hundred years is scratch at it.
I have the feelin' if they

56
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,500
get it in their big heads
to do somethin' else,

57
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,167
we'll be more 'n ready for 'em.

58
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,792
A feeling? What have
any of you actually done

59
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,042
to be ready for 'em?

60
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,667
Dad says you've
gotta stay sharp!

61
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,500
Ah, good Doctor
Jaeger. Yeah, well.

62
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,667
[HANNES] Can't argue with
a man who single-handedly

63
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,792
[HANNES] spared us
from the plague.

64
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,000
[HANNES] Thing is, he's
talkin' about his scalpel.

65
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,125
[HANNES] What we do
isn't half as important.

66
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,792
Hey, no disrespect to your
father, but a soldier's time

67
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,917
beyond the wall kinda tends
to put the whole issue

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,917
into a different perspective.

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,458
[HANNES] You see 'em
groping around out there,

70
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,917
[HANNES] mindless, dead-eyed.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
[EREN] Wait a minute.
Sounds to me like you

72
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,958
[EREN] don't even think
they're all that dangerous.

73
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,208
[HANNES] Eh.

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,542
Oh great! Then at least
have the decency to stop

75
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,667
calling yourselves a garrison;
people might get the wrong idea!

76
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,833
[laughing] Good point.

77
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,250
Look at it this way, huh?
If a garrison's actually doing

78
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,708
what people think it
oughta, we're up a creek.

79
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:27,125
Personally I take a lot of stock
in being called a freeloader,

80
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,375
it means things are good. It's
how I can measure peace of mind.

81
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:40,417
[EREN] Good? We live in a cage.
All we do is eat and sleep.

82
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,042
[EREN] That's it. End of story.

83
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,375
We have the peace
of mind of livestock.

84
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,333
[laughing] Man, you were right
about the kid havin' fire!

85
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,625
Careful not to cry it out.

86
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,792
[ELITE MAN] You coming
back to the game or what?

87
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,875
Yeah.

88
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,833
[HANNES] Hey! Where you goin'?

89
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,167
[HUGO] The mouth on that kid.

90
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,833
He's just a kid.

91
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,250
Tends to dream bigger than
life really wants him to.

92
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,417
Eren. You should let
the Scout Regiment thing go.

93
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,292
Seriously? Why does everybody
think they're a joke?

94
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,875
What people think about
'em isn't really the issue.

00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:35,875
[bell ringing]

96
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,125
[EREN] Perfect timing!
They're back!

97
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:42,833
We can make it if we hurry. Get
a move on! I want a good view!

[CITIZEN] Sure taken
a hit, haven't they?

104
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,042
[CITIZEN] Yeah. Rest of 'em
got eaten. That's what happens

105
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,292
[CITIZEN] when pride takes
you outside the walls.

106
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,333
[WOMAN'S VOICE] Moses? Moses?

107
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:42,250
Beg your pardon. Where is my
son? He should be with you all.

108
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,792
Oh, please tell me he made it!

109
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,458
I wish I had better
news. Give it to her.

110
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:12,917

112
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,625
I'm sorry. It's all
that was left of him.

115
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,708
He-- He did good,
yes? He was brave?

116
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,083
Tell me my son stood his
ground to the bitter end.

117
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,833
That his death
meant something!

118
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:51,125
Tell me his sacrifice
gave us a better chance!

119
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,833
He was brave!

120
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:05,875
[KEITH] But. His
sacrifice meant nothing.

121
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,375
[KEITH] So with all our
losses. It's ever the same.

122
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:15,833
The day was lost!
We have nothing!

123
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,417
[KEITH] Your son died because
of me! I sent him to his death!

124
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,167
[KEITH] I sent all
of them to their deaths!

125
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,167
And there's nothing
to show for it!

126
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,125
All of it amounts to nothing!

127
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,542
[chatter]

128
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,125
[COMMONER] Uplifting, huh.

129
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,667
Oh, sure. Nothing like seeing
our hard-earned taxes go toward

130
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,625
keeping those bastards fat
and happy on human gristle.

131
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,333
[COMMONER] You little punk!

[EREN] What are
you doing? Let me go!

133
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,333
Yeah, that's right!
You'd better run!

134
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,875
[EREN] Alright, I get
it! Stop already!

135
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:08,583
[EREN] Oh great! Firewood
everywhere! Perfect!

136
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,000
So. Are you still
bound and determined

137
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,542
to become one
of them? The Scouts?

138
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,125
[EREN] Just help
me pick these up.

139
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:29,000
[MIKASA] Like there
was much to begin with.

140
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,625
Hey, we're home.

141
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,833
Welcome back, kids.

142
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,958
Wow. Somebody worked
hard to keep us in fuel

143
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,417
for the next several days.

144
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,292
Eh. Whatever.

145
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,042
What was that for?

146
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,333
Your earlobe's red, which means
you've got something to hide.

147
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,667
Mikasa helped you
again, now didn't she?

148
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,583
Hey. Where you off to, Dad?

149
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,708
A patient?

150
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,167
Yes. Some folks
in the Interior.

151
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,708
I should be back
in about a week or so.

152
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:25,375
So, um, Eren's thinking
about joining the Scouts.

153
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,250
Way to keep a secret, mouth!

154
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,875
Get that ridiculous
thought out of your head

155
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,375
this instant, young man!

156
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,208
No son of mine is
going to be fodder!

157
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,458
Do I make myself
absolutely clear?

158
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,875
Stop yelling at me!

159
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,750
Don't you dare--

160
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,500
It's a nightmare, Eren.

161
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,750
The Outside. You
really have no idea.

162
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:52,083
Yeah, I get it, okay? But it's
gotta be better than this life!

163
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm not stupid; I know
it's ugly out there,

164
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,500
I know there's death
around every corner. But--

165
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,958
We can't just give up on it.

166
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:04,708
'Cause otherwise this
nightmare's never gonna end!

167
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,208
I see.

168
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,250
Excuse me. I'll be
late for the ferry.

169
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,625
Darling, wait! Scold the boy,
for heaven's sake!

170
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,208
Scold him? Dear, please.
Think this through.

171
