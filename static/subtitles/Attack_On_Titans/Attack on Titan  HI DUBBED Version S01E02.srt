[NARRATOR] The calculated
design flaw in all

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,875
I'll kill them all.

174
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,792
Every last one.

175
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,500
Eren.

176
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,583
[NARRATOR] In terrified haste,
The Central Government

177
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,292
[NARRATOR] declared the
Outlier Districts a lost cause

178
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,375
[NARRATOR] and decreed
all mankind retreat

179
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,250
[NARRATOR] behind Wall Rose.
Estimates held that nearly

180
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,292
[NARRATOR] ten-thousand
lives were lost

181
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,292
[NARRATOR] to the
Titan offensive.

182
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:05,375
Eren. Carla. Mikasa.
Please be alive!

183
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:13,083
[GRISHA] Eren! Stay
with me, boy! Wake up!

184
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,708
[EREN] Stop it!
Please, you're scaring me!

185
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,500
[EREN] I don't understand
what you're trying to do!

186
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,458
[GRISHA] You don't have to!
Just give me your arm!

187
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,917
[EREN] No! You're insane!

188
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
[EREN] Mom's death pushed
you off the deep end!

189
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,375
[GRISHA] Shut up!

190
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,583
[EREN] Get off! Let me go!

191
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,833
Damn you, this
is the only way!

192
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,875
[EREN] You're not
making any sense!

193
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,042
[GRISHA] You cannot
forget the key!

194
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,833
[GRISHA] Whatever you
do, you must reach it!

195
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,792
[GRISHA] It's the
way to the Truth!

196
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,625
[GRISHA] One day
you'll understand!

197
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:51,583
[bells ringing]

198
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,667
Hey. It's okay.
You were just dreaming.

199
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,042
Dad was-- It felt so real.

200
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,375
Nightmare. Shake it off.

201
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,375
Yeah.

202
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,208
[MIKASA] Come on.

203
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,417
They're handing out food
rations near the warehouse.

204
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,583
[MIKASA] I think this
used to be where they

205
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,625
[MIKASA] stored
all the dry goods.

206
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,292
[MIKASA] Now it's where
they corral the refugees.

207
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,917
[gasp]

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,042
[chattering]

209
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,583
[COMMONER] I don't
think so, friend!

210
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,000
[ANOTHER COMMONER]
Give me a break!

211
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,417
All I've had for two
days is a moldy bit of crust!

212
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,000
Not exactly a
dignified existence.

213
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,125
[ARMIN] Hey guys!

214
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,000
[EREN] Armin.

215
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,792
Glad I caught you. Here.
Grandpa scrounged a little extra

216
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,125
by telling the
powers-that-be he had kids.

217
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,625
That was nice of him.

218
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,875
Tch!

219
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,458
What's his deal?

220
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,208
Just ignore it.
There's a shortage.

221
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,292
Poor man's probably hungry.

222
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,708
By the way,
I'd make that last.

223
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,500
[ARMIN] They were
already dealing with famine

224
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,083
[ARMIN] before we
got here, so it's

225
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,875
[ARMIN] an ugly situation.
That, and this far in

226
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,542
[ARMIN] there's a
greater disparity between

227
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,458
[ARMIN] the haves
and the have-nots.

228
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,583
Nothin' more gratifyin' than

229
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,833
seein' your rations
go to animals.

230
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,208
Guess we gotta beef
up the herd, though.

231
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:33,375
Eat up, the Titans like a
little meat on their bones!

232
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,375
Eren, wait!

233
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,667
Oughta keep you in cages.

234
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,958
Shove you out to the
frontlines as a buffer.

235
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,333
Oww! Damn it! You picked
the wrong man, asshole!

236
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,250
Spineless cowards! All of you!

237
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,875
You don't-- You don't
know what it's like!

238
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,042
Huh?

239
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,542
You seen one? You
seen what they can do?

240
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,333
You little piece o'--

241
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:04,667
He's sorry! He didn't
mean it; he's just hungry.

242
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,708
We all get that way; speak our
minds out of turn sometimes?

243
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,792
Forgive him. I beg you.

244
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,708
Yeah, well. Keep in
mind who's givin' up

245
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,708
their share so you can eat.

246
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,708
In case you hadn't
noticed, we're all hungry.

247
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,750
[ELITE] Tell your buddy a little
gratitude goes a long way.

248
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,333
Sure!

249
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:31,083
Bastard. I'm not about to
show gratitude to a coward!

250
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:35,542
[EREN] I can't do this.
I'm going back to Wall Maria.

251
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,667
[EREN] The Titans have to pay
for what they've done to us.

252
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,000
Hey, now. You're not serious;
that's your stomach talking.

253
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,375
No, it's not!

254
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,917
Wake up! The guys standing
between us and them

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,833
are just a bunch of talk!

256
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,542
To hell with all of 'em!
Here. I'm going back!

257
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,583
Yeah? What're you
tying to do, starve?

258
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,583
When are you gonna
get sick of their charity?

259
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,042
Too much is handed to us!

260
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,958
We have to stand
on our own two feet!

261
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,167
To do what? Get
killed by a Titan?

262
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,625
I know I used
to think our future

263
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,417
was beyond the walls. But
it's like you told that man.

264
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,250
I'd never seen what
they could do to us!

265
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,583
So that's it? This
is just the way life is?

266
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,208
Run away and take
what we're given?

267
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,583
Look at us! What
choice do we have here?

268
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,417
We can damn-well leave!
If you wanna scrape by on

that's your thing,

[MIKASA] Have you looked

[MIKASA] All of
us are parasites.

[MIKASA] We couldn't run from

275
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,167
[MIKASA] Tell me differently.

276
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,917
[MIKASA] Don't take your
shortcomings out on him.

277
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,125
[MIKASA] For god's sake, we
can't even find food on our own.

278
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,750
[MIKASA] We're parasites.
We're cowards.

279
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,792
[MIKASA] Titans are at the
top of the food chain. Period.

280
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,792
Pride be damned; we
do what we must to live.

Your mom didn't
ask us to be brave.

Mikasa!

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,625
Eat it. She asked
us to stay alive.
