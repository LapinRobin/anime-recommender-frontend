Anime name : Attack On Titan
ï»¿1
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,817
Hey, Mop-Top!

2
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,817
Sir!

3
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:44,400
[KEITH] What do they
call you, maggot?

4
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,942
[ARMIN] Armin Arlelt,
from Shinganshina, sir!

5
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,525
Wow, seriously?
Why would your parents

6
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,192
curse you with
such a dumb name?

7
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,067
[ARMIN] It was
my grandfather, sir!

8
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,567
Cadet Arlelt! Why is
a runt like you here?

9
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,108
To help humanity
overcome the Titans!

10
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:58,650
That is delightful to hear!

11
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,692
You're gonna be a
great light snack for him!

12
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:03,192
Row Three, About Face, runt!

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,608
What do you call yourself?

14
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,525
Sir. My name is Thomas Wagner,
I'm from the Trost district!

15
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:09,858
I can't hear you!

16
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:11,150
[THOMAS] I'm from
Trost, sir, my name--

17
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:14,358
Look at him go.
The man is a master

18
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,650
when it comes to
fresh-faced recruits.

19
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,192
That takes me back.

20
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:21,233
Is a pathetic worm like you
the best Karaness has to offer?

21
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,483
Sir! I'm afraid
that's the case, sir!

22
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,692
Tell your backwoods--

23
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,108
But what's the point
of all the intimidation?

24
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:28,358
It's a Rite of Passage.
Through stress and denigration

25
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,025
we revert them
into blank slates.

26
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,442
From there, we can mold them
bit by bit into proper soldiers.

27
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,900
He is the first
step in that process.

28
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,317
We seem to really excel
at that back home, sir!

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
[KEITH] Row Four, About Face!

30
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,900
[YOUNG INSTRUCTOR] There
are some he's passing by.

31
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,275
[INSTRUCTOR] A drill instructor
is nothing compared to

32
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,483
[INSTRUCTOR] what those
recruits have seen.

33
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,608
[INSTRUCTOR] They were there.
Witnesses to the hell of

34
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:53,108
[INSTRUCTOR] the Titan
attack two years ago.

35
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,233
[INSTRUCTOR] You can
read it in their faces.

36
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:57,317
[INSTRUCTOR] C'mon. Let's go.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,942
What do we have over here?

38
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,358
Jean Kirschtein, sir.
From the Trost District!

39
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,650
And why're you here, cadet?

40
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,233
To join the Military Police,
sir. The best of the best.

41
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:12,358
[KEITH] That's nice. You want
to live in the interior, do you?

42
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,317
Yes!

43
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:17,150
[KEITH] No one told
you to sit, Recruit!

44
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:18,650
If you can't handle
this, Kirschtein,

45
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,483
then forget about
joining the Military Police!

46
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,608
What the hell is wrong with
your face, you smiling idiot?

47
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,608
Marco Bodt at your
service, sir, from Jinae.

48
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:29,317
South side of Wall Rose. I aim
to join the Military Police

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,942
and give life and limb
in service to the king!

50
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:38,275
Well then. That makes you
an idealistic fool. And a rube.

51
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:39,733
[KEITH] You want the truth?

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,233
The only use the king has for

53
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:45,358
your life and limbs
are as Titan fodder.

54
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,400
Hey, Cue-ball. You're up next!

55
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh, me? Sir! Conny Springer,
from Ragako village, sir!

56
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:56,858
You have it backwards,
Conny Springer.

57
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,817
That was the first
thing you were taught.

58
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,192
This salute
represents the resolve

59
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,483
in your heart to
fight those bent on

60
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,942
the systematic
destruction of our people!

61
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,983
Is your heart
on your right side?

62
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:09,650
[chewing]

63
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,358
Hey, you there. What
do you think you're doing?

64
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,358
[chewing]

65
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,275
You are officially
on my shit list.

66
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:28,817
Just who in the hell are you?

67
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,858
[swallow]

68
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,858
Sasha Braus from Dauper
village, at your service.

69
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,233
Reporting for duty, sir!

70
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,192
Sasha Braus, huh?

71
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:40,192
And what is that you're
clutching in your right hand?

72
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,942
A steamed potato!

73
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,275
It sat there in the mess
hall begging to be eaten. Sir!

74
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,150
The theft, I understand.

75
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:52,192
But here? Why eat
it here of all places?

76
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:55,275
It looked quite delicious.
And it was getting cold.

77
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,983
So I gave it shelter
in my stomach, sir.

78
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:04,400
Why? I can't comprehend.
Why would you eat that potato?

79
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:08,567
Are you asking me
why people eat potatoes?

80
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,442
I'm surprised
you don't know, sir.

81
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,858
Here sir. Have half.

82
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,692
"Have half?" Really?

83
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,317
Man, I thought Sadies
was gonna kill Potato Girl.

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,900
I know. What a
helluva first day.

85
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:45,108
[EREN] It's funny. Being
told to run 'til the sun sets

86
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:46,817
[EREN] didn't seem to
bother her nearly as much as

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,858
[EREN] losing meal privileges
for the next five days.

88
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,608
I think she said
that she's from Dauper.

89
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,650
If I remember right,
that's a small hunting village

90
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,775
up in the mountains.

91
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,608
Hey, what's that?

92
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,067
[MINA] They're dropouts. They'd
prefer to work in the fields.

93
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,567
[ARMIN] But. It's
only the first day.

94
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,150
[EREN] That's the way it is.

95
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,192
[EREN] If you can't handle the
pressure, you've gotta leave.

96
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:13,900
I can't believe anyone would
rather pull plants than fight.

97
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,650
I know about some of us,
but you never mentioned

98
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,442
where you were from, Eren.

99
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,442
The same as Armin.
From Shinganshina.

100
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:24,150
Oh, wow. That means.

101
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,525
You saw it. You
were there that day.

102
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:27,733
Huh? Quiet!

103
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:30,275
The Colossal one?
Did you see him?

104
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,692
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

105
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:38,150
Yeah, okay? I saw the big guy.

106
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,817
Whoa, seriously?

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,858
Okay, exactly how tall was he?

108
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,900
He stuck his head
over the outer wall.

109
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,817
Whoa, wait! I heard he stepped
over the wall completely.

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,983
So did I!

111
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,942
That was the rumor
in my village, too!

112
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,567
Nah. He was big,
but not that big.

113
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,692
So what did it look like?

114
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:58,317
It had a mouth like a corpse.
And no skin, just muscles.

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,733
And the Armored Titan? The one
that broke through Wall Maria?

116
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,983
Is that what they're
calling it? In all the panic,

117
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,275
[EREN] it was just
another Titan to me.

118
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:09,692
No way. So,
what were they like?

119
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,942
C'mon. That's enough questions,
alright? I'm sure he'd rather

120
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,900
not relive everything
he went through.

121
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,483
Sorry. We didn't mean to--

122
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,108
[EREN] It's not like that!

123
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,650
[chewing]

124
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:33,275
Those stupid Titans. They're
really not that big of a deal.

125
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,233
If we focus on mastering the
Omni-Directional Mobility Gear

126
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:39,608
they give us, then
it's Titan payback time!

127
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,692
[EREN] I've waited years
to be trained as a soldier.

128
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,483
[EREN] All of a sudden,
the reality is sinking in.

129
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,942
I'm joining the Scout
Regiment. Then I'm sending

130
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:51,400
the Titans back to hell.
I'm gonna butcher them all.

131
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,858
[JEAN] Hey, are you
crazy or something?

132
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,442
Not that it's my
business, but signing up

133
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,858
for reconnaissance is
like a death sentence.

134
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:01,358
I guess we'll see.
Or at least I will.

135
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,483
You seem content hiding
in the interior with the MPs.

136
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,025
Look, I'm just speaking
honestly here, kid.

137
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,817
I think it's better
than being some loud mouthed

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,775
braggart tough-guy
wannabe pretending

139
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,567
he's not as piss-scared
as the rest of us.

140
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,233
Are you trying to pick a fight?

141
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,692
[MARCO] Stop it you guys!

142
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:21,067
Alright, sure. Makes
no difference to me.

143
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,275
[BOTH] Huh?

144
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:33,483
Hey. I apologize.
Sorry for calling you names

145
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,858
and dismissing
your choice of career.

146
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,275
Put 'er there,
kid. Whaddaya say?

147
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,192
Right. Yeah, I'm sorry as well.

148
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,525
[JEAN] Umm. Excuse me?

149
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:03,733
I-- Uh. I just
wanted-- I mean.

150
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:06,817
I've never seen anyone
like you before. I mean, uh.

151
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,108
I'm-- I'm sorry. You have
really beautiful black hair.

152
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:13,650
Thank you.

153
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,358
Would you lay off?
It's no big deal!

154
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:25,692
It's just that
you get so worked up

155
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,733
you don't think things through.

156
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,233
Again with this?

157
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,900
[EREN] If you
insist on worrying,

158
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:32,900
[EREN] worry about
how long your hair is.

159
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,442
[EREN] It's gonna catch
up with you in a bad way

160
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,608
[EREN] when we
start on the ODMs.

161
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:40,483
Okay, fine. I'll cut it.

162
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,983
[MIKASA] How short
should I go, do you think?

163
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,775
[humming]

164
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,442
What the hell? Leave
my clothes alone, dammit!

165
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,358
[CONNY] What did you wipe on me?

166
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Don't worry. Just my trust.

167
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:03,275
I'm... finished.

168
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:11,150
[wheezing]

169
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,317
[sniffing]

170
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,858
[shriek]

171
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:26,108
Could it be? It's bread!

172
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,983
I'm sorry there isn't
more. It's all I could take.

173
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,442
Hey, hang on. You really should
drink a little water first.

174
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:41,733
You-- You're a Goddess,
aren't you? Glory unto you!

175
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,733
Hey. Just what are
you two girls up to?

176
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:50,400
Well, uh. She's been running all
day. Without any food or water.

177
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,817
I see. So you're
trying to be "nice," huh?

178
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,983
Eh?

179
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:03,108
What's the point of breakin'
the rules for Potato Girl?

180
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:07,192
That mindless act of kindness
gets you absolutely nowhere.

181
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:11,775
Whatever.

182
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,567
[YMIR] Let's just
get her to bed already.

183
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,858
I'm confused.
Are you being nice?

184
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:23,025
I'm helping her so that she'll
owe me one in the future.

185
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:26,233
I intend to make
use of her stupidity.

186
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,692
It's aptitude test
time, so listen up!

187
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,108
There is no place for you
here if you cannot perform!

188
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:38,650
Fail, and be shipped
to the fields.

189
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,900
[INSTRUCTOR] We're just
drilling the fundamentals here.

190
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,525
You can still determine
a Cadet's knack

191
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,275
for it just by watching.

192
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:50,108
Like her. Completely steady.

193
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,692
[INSTRUCTOR] She
inherently knows what to do,

194
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,650
[INSTRUCTOR] and how
to make it happen.

195
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:56,733
[INSTRUCTOR] That's what
aptitude is all about.

196
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:58,858
[INSTRUCTOR] I'd
say we have several

197
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:00,608
[INSTRUCTOR] capable
cadets this year.

198
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,442
And what about this guy?

199
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:06,233
That's precisely
why we run these tests.

200
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,400
He proves that drive
and dedication do not

201
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:11,150
[INSTRUCTOR] always
translate into capability.

202
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:13,983
What is your major
malfunction, Jaeger?

203
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,775
Straighten yourself up!

204
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,025
[snickering]

205
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:20,400
[EREN] Why am I--
How do I work this thing?

206
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,442
This can't be happening!

207
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,317
Just remember the basics
and you should be fine.

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,483
No need to try
any fancy maneuvers.

209
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,942
Just focus on your balance.

210
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,692
Then distribute your
weight evenly between

211
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,108
the belts on your
waist and your legs.

212
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,900
Loosen up your
stance a little bit.

213
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,108
If I could do it,
I know that you can!

214
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:54,108
Okay. A loose
stance, but balanced.

215
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:55,858
Let's give it a shot, Armin.

216
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:14,192
Hey, Daz. He was talking big
about butchering all the Titans,

217
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:17,525
but he got real quiet after
ODM training, didn't he?

218
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:20,317
I guess it's the fields
for him tomorrow.

219
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,942
Can't keep wasting
food on the useless.

220
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:25,108
Eren.

221
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,733
[ARMIN] Worrying
won't solve a thing.

222
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,400
[ARMIN] There's still time
to get some practice in

223
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:30,733
[ARMIN] come morning.

224
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:33,650
[EREN] How pathetic. How
am I supposed to kill 'em

225
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,358
[EREN] if I can't
even stand up straight?

226
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,650
[MIKASA] It might be
time to let that dream die.

227
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,733
Whaddaya mean?

228
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:43,650
I think you should give up
this attempt to be a soldier.

229
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,483
There's a lot more
to fighting and combat

230
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,900
than just throwing
your life away in vain.

231
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,483
What're you saying? After
everything we saw that day,

232
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,067
after what happened to my mom.

233
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,108
You're crazy if you think
I'm just going to walk away.

234
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:58,483
I get it. But it doesn't
matter how determined you are.

235
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,525
It-- Wait, what do you mean?

236
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:01,692
Because whether or not

237
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:05,108
you're fit to be a
soldier isn't up to you.

238
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,400
You misunderstand.
I'm not saying you should

239
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,775
return to the
fields by yourself.

240
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,817
I wouldn't dream of it.

241
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,025
Because wherever you go.
I'm gonna go with you--

242
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:30,692
[SASHA] So. Uh.
Are you saying...

243
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:34,400
[SASHA] that you're not
going to finish that?

244
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,983
[CONNY] What's the trick to
posture control? Hard to say.

245
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:58,650
Guess I got the "gift". You've
just gotta feel it, y'know?

246
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,692
I'm trying to
figure out your trick.

247
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,525
You've screwed
upevery way imaginable,

248
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:05,817
short of an accidental
equipment-related asphyxiation.

249
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,525
Please guys. You gotta
help me, I'm begging you!

250
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,150
That's funny. Wasn't
it just yesterday you said

251
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:15,025
"if you can't handle the
pressure, you gotta leave?"

252
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,567
[CONNY] No, wait. Or was it
"if you're a complete idiot,

253
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,775
you gotta leave?"
Something like that.

254
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:23,775
Oh, come on.

255
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:25,942
I heard from everyone
you're both really good at it!

256
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,608
[EREN] Bertholdt! Reiner!

257
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,025
Sorry kid. But there
isn't any special trick

258
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,608
to just hanging there.
Not to be harsh,

259
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,900
but if it's advice you want,
I'm not really the guy.

260
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,358
Alright.

261
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,108
[ARMIN] Let's just hope
it comes to you tomorrow.

262
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,900
Hold on. Aren't the two of you
originally from Shiganshina?

263
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,775
Yeah, that's right.

264
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:49,775
Then you know first-hand
how terrifying they are.

265
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,733
Why on earth would
you want to be soldiers?

266
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,775
I didn't see
the things. Eren did.

267
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,192
He saw their
bloodlust first hand,

268
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:00,942
before anyone realized
how bad it was.

269
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,608
And I-- I knew I couldn't sit
idly by as the royal government

270
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,733
forced the citizenry
into the failed

271
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:09,483
territory retrieval operation.

272
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,608
[BERTHOLDT] I see.

273
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:13,233
So where are
the two of you from?

274
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:16,358
Oh, Reiner and I? We were
both from a mountain village

275
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,400
just Southeast of Wall Maria.

276
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,567
But. Then that means.

277
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,483
[BERTHOLDT] Yeah. Unlike the
more prosperous river towns,

278
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,233
[BERTHOLDT] our village
didn't receive word right away.

279
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,608
[BERTHOLDT]
The Titans were on us

280
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:30,483
[BERTHOLDT] before we
even knew what was going on.

281
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:36,275
It happened at dawn. All the
livestock were so restless.

282
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,358
Soon after, we heard
these strange rumblings

283
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,775
that just became
louder and louder.

284
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,400
[BERTHOLDT] Eventually, I
realized those rumblings were

285
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:48,358
[BERTHOLDT] the sound of
death getting closer. I, uh...

286
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,733
[BERTHOLDT] I looked
out my window, and--

287
00:16:57,442 --> 00:17:02,567
After that, well, uh.
Everything is just a blur.

288
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,775
I think we all just panicked.

289
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,067
Hey. Easy now.

290
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,150
You're just getting
yourself worked up again.

291
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:12,775
Sorry. Basically, what I've
been trying to say is this.

292
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,817
The four of us aren't
like the rest of-- of them.

293
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,067
"Them" who?

294
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,233
The others here who've never

295
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,483
been witness to
the Titan's horror.

296
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,983
Hey.

297
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:27,150
[chattering and laughter]

298
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,692
[BERTHOLDT] Most of
them are here for show.

299
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:34,817
To do just what
society expects.

300
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,983
In a world where you're
labeled a coward if you choose

301
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,942
fieldwork by the
time you turn twelve,

302
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,442
propriety demands our service.

303
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:46,983
With that said, I'm really
no different from the others.

304
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,858
[BERTHOLDT] I joined the
ranks hoping for assignment to

305
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,608
[BERTHOLDT] the Military Police.
Tucked away in the Interior.

306
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:55,358
[BERTHOLDT] If that doesn't
work out, I'll give up entirely.

307
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:59,525
[BERTHOLDT] I don't really have
the fortitude for anything else.

308
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:02,483
[ARMIN] There's no
shame in caring about

309
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,567
[ARMIN] your life,
Bertholdt. We all do.

310
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,733
Do we?

311
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,275
[REINER] I'm going
to return to the home

312
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:14,900
[REINER] that was taken from me.
That's all I care about now.

313
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,400
I will do it. No matter what.

314
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:25,233
[BERTHOLDT] What about
you? Why did you sign up?

315
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,275
Why'd I join?

316
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:36,608
I decided I have to kill them.

317
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,483
[EREN] I won't stop
'til every single

318
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,942
[EREN] Titan is
dead and rotting.

319
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,900
Dead. Every last one.

320
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,817
[REINER] You saw what those
monsters are capable of,

321
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,608
[REINER] and you still
want to take them on?

322
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:56,650
[EREN] Damn right. It's just,
after screwing up the training,

323
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,483
[EREN] I don't know if
I'm cut out to be a soldier.

324
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,983
[REINER] We'll take it from
step one: Belt Adjustment.

325
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,150
[REINER] By tomorrow,
you'll be an expert.

326
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:27,275
I know you've got what it
takes. I can see it in you.

327
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:28,775
Am I wrong here?

328
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:33,775
No! I won't fail. Thank you,
Reiner. Thank you.

329
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:47,025
Eren Jaeger. Are you ready?

330
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:51,692
[EREN] Yes sir! I'm
going to do it. I have to!

331
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,817
[EREN] I may not be
as talented as the rest.

332
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,817
[EREN] But nobody,
nobody, has more guts!

333
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,442
Proceed!

334
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:11,983
[EREN] The moment of truth. I
won't fail again. To hell with

335
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,567
[EREN] working the damn
fields! I'm not giving up.

336
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,608
[EREN] Not without a fight!

337
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:22,108
[cheering]

338
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:25,483
[EREN] I did it?
No, I'm doing it!

339
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,650
[gasp]

340
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,400
No! Not yet!

341
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:39,067
Once more! I can do it!

342
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,025
Lower him.

343
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,442
I-- I'm finished.

344
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:53,317
Wagner! Please exchange
belts with Mr. Jaeger.

345
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,983
Huh? Yes sir!

346
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,942
[KEITH] Your equipment
was defective.

347
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,692
If given a piece of
functional gear,

348
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:09,608
you might not be
worthless after all.

349
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:12,483
[KEITH] Quartermaster didn't
notice this broken clasp.

350
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,067
[KEITH] Might have to
visit the Supply Depot

351
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,983
[KEITH] and crack
a couple skulls.

352
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,567
He-- He still did it. Even while
wearing that busted gear.

353
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,483
Amazing.

354
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:24,650
So, you mean I--
I didn't wash out?

355
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,733
You made the cut.
Now keep training, cadet!

356
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,983
[EREN] I did it.
I really did it!

357
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:35,025
[EREN] Check it out,
Mikasa! I'm doing it!

358
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:37,150
[EREN] I can fight the Titans!

359
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,525
[EREN] You don't
have to worry about me!

360
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:40,983
[EREN] Not anymore!

361
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,358
It seems like
things worked out for him.

362
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:46,983
Look, his eyes are
saying "check me out!"

363
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,108
They're not.

364
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:54,775
His eyes are saying he doesn't
have to leave me. Not anymore.

365
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,275
[KEITH] Grisha. Today
should bring you pride.

366
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,108
[KEITH] Your son is a soldier!

367
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:15,150
âª

368
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:24,608
âª

369
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,733
[NARRATOR] After
graduating from the Cadets,

370
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:03,442
[NARRATOR] Eren sees mankind
begin to restore its dignity.

371
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,150
[NARRATOR]
"We can beat the Titans."

372
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:08,108
[NARRATOR] The moment
he feels certain of this,

373
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,817
[NARRATOR] humanity
is given a grim reminder.
