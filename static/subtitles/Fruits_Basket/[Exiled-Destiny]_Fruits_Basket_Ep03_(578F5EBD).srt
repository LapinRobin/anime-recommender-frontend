00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:17,157
<i>I was so very happy</i>
<i>when you smiled at me,</i>

2
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:23,097
<i>A smile that melted everything away.</i>

3
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:30,604
<i>Spring is still far away,</i>
<i>and within the cold ground,</i>

4
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:36,143
<i>I awaited the time when</i>
<i>sprouts would put forth their buds.</i>

5
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:39,546
<i>Even supposing today there</i>
<i>may have been some pain,</i>

6
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:43,217
<i>And though the scars of yesterday remain,</i>

7
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:50,057
<i>You can go on living as much</i>
<i>as your heart wants to believe.</i>

8
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:53,427
<i>You cannot be born again, although</i>

9
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:57,865
<i>You can go on changing yourself, and so</i>

10
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:02,997
<i>Let's stay together, always.</i>

11
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,490
Are you really Sohma-<i>kun</i>'s cousin?

12
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,550
Do you get along well with Sohma-<i>kun</i>?

13
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,960
Leave me alone!

14
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,061
Kyo-<i>san...</i>

15
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:49,182
Hey...

16
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:52,519
Would you use your head a bit
more before you take action?

17
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,188
When you make a fool of
yourself, it puts me out.

18
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:57,223
Are you in your right mind?

19
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:58,758
How come you're going
to a school like this...

20
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,527
with girls bounding
around every which-way?

21
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:02,596
Living in fear every day of
transforming is far preferable

22
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:05,665
to living like I'm in hiding,

23
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:08,868
and going to the boys'
school that Akito decided on.

24
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:13,329
I wanted to get out of the
Sohma cage, if even a little bit.

25
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:18,545
How could a Rat...
how could you understand?

26
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:21,548
I will win! I will surely win against you!

27
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:25,151
I will win against you, and
become a formal member of the Sohmas!

28
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:27,916
I won't stand for
being shunned any longer!

29
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,492
I'm going to win!

30
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:33,892
You mustn't!

31
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,334
I'm so sorry!

32
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,838
It's understandable why you're angry,
but you must not... must not fight!

33
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:48,842
After all, if you fight at school,
there is much that works against you...

34
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:50,844
--mmit...

35
00:02:50,844 --> 00:02:52,545
Just cram it, would you!

36
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:53,780
Whether it works against me or not,

37
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,382
as long as I beat him,
nothing else matters!

38
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,183
Stay out of the way!
Who the hell are you!?

39
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:59,652
You're nasty to look at!

40
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,858
"Max Anger."

41
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:08,920
He hates me.
Now he completely hates me.

42
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:13,533
You really are an idiot.

43
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,202
Aren't you going to hit me?

44
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,831
There are times when it hurts
more like that, you know.

45
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,480
<i>Whenever I think about how,</i>
<i>in a faraway mountain,</i>

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,983
Welcome to
the Banquet
<i>Whenever I think about how,</i>
<i>in a faraway mountain,</i>

47
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:32,485
Welcome to
the Banquet
<i>while God and the twelve animals</i>
<i>were enjoying their banquet,</i>

48
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:35,689
Welcome to
the Banquet
<i>the Cat-san had gone to bed,</i>

49
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,826
<i>dreaming about a banquet that</i>
<i>would not be held tomorrow...</i>

50
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:44,497
I've made up my mind! I'm giving up
Dog-<i>san</i>, and I will become Cat-<i>san</i>!

51
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:49,993
<i>I truly meant what I said.</i>
<i>Tears really did come forth.</i>

52
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:54,641
<i>I was so avid, that if there were</i>
<i>such a thing as a Cat fan club,</i>

53
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,509
<i>I would absolutely join it.</i>

54
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,511
<i>And yet, to be hated by him...</i>

55
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:03,211
<i>I am a fool. A real fool. Mother...</i>

56
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,853
Picking up Tohru-<i>kun</i>'s vibes...

57
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,189
Ah, there she is.

58
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,858
What are you kneeling for in a place
like this? Class is about to beg--

59
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:16,529
Ee-yow! It hurts so bad, t- the tears...!

60
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,532
No, really, I just bumped
the corner here, the corner...

61
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:23,803
Somehow, it looked as
though you hit it on purpose.

62
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:27,474
And so? You skipped out just like
that and came back home, then?

63
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,476
I want to leave this house.

64
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:31,644
It's only been three days, right?

65
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:35,148
Think of this as training
too, and put up with it.

66
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:38,485
I say nothing but
terrible things... to her.

67
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:41,821
To her? You mean to Tohru-<i>kun</i>?

68
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:45,492
Uh-huh. You yelled at her again with
the same tone as you always use, right?

69
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:48,561
If it gets you down afterward,
you could just not yell, you know.

70
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,830
Such a wretched temperament.

71
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,835
It's no use. I'm just not cut out for
associating and living with people.

72
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,671
There are people who are
like that, but in your case,

73
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:03,176
it just comes from not having
enough experience with them.

74
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:08,081
For example, with one fist,
you can break a table in half.

75
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:11,518
However, you can also make
that fist stop just short of it.

76
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,520
That's because you can control
by yourself how much power

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,855
to portion out your fist, right?

78
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:18,491
That's also why you were successful
when fighting with bears and stuff

79
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,859
--while training in the mountains.
--I didn't fight them!

80
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:25,491
Look, you. It's the same with
getting along well with other people.

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,869
It's just that this training
can't be done in the mountains.

82
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:33,473
It has to be done in the
cities, where people live.

83
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,041
Unless you interact with people,

84
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,645
hurting them and being hurt by
them as you learn about them,

85
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:41,481
as well as learn about yourself,

86
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:45,577
you'll never become the kind of person
who can be concerned about others.

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,823
Even though you may have a
black belt in the martial arts,

88
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,491
you still have a white belt
at getting along with others.

89
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,260
In order for you to become
able to cherish a girl,

90
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,162
who at some point is kind enough
to tell you that she likes you,

91
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,832
right now, you have to continue
to train, without running away.

92
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,501
There'll never be anyone like that.

93
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,836
But if there were, what would you do?

94
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:07,507
I can't even imagine.
First, I'd ask if she was crazy.

95
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:08,508
I see.

96
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,843
I'm home!

97
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,511
Ah, welcome back.

98
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,512
Where's Tohru-<i>kun</i>?

99
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:16,216
Working. She said she'll
be coming back around 11:00,

100
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:17,517
so I was thinking of
going to pick her up.

101
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,686
Yeah, do that for her.

102
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,246
There have really been a lot
of molesters around lately.

103
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:30,129
<i>I worked a full day today too.</i>
<i>I wonder if everyone is asleep already.</i>

104
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,701
<i>I'll bet Kyo-san hasn't</i>
<i>eaten supper again tonight.</i>

105
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:38,805
<i>He's still angry... or what</i>
<i>if he left the house entirely!?</i>

106
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:41,001
<i>You're nasty to look at!</i>

107
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,477
<i>What will I do?</i>

108
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:47,480
<i>Tohru, you just be yourself.</i>

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,482
Yes, Mother!

110
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:51,678
<i>I will not be discouraged.</i>

111
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:57,655
<i>W- what was that sound?</i>

112
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:05,832
Maybe it's... a molester...
like I've heard about...!

113
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,130
No!!

114
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:19,913
<i>I couldn't say that I mistook him</i>
<i>for a molester! That would be rude!</i>

115
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:23,008
<i>But I just yelled "No!"</i>
<i>as loud as I could...</i>

116
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:27,220
U- um, just a moment!
That was a practice swing.

117
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,121
I just happened to get lucky today.

118
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:30,790
Kyo-<i>san</i>, are you out for a walk?
Let's see... do you like the school?

119
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,386
Stop saying "<i>san</i>" after my name!
It irritates me. You can do without it.

120
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,465
--Kyo-<i>kun...</i>
--What do you want?

121
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:41,134
I was just trying it out.

122
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,137
--Don't call on me
without a reason!
--Right!

123
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:49,475
No, I mean... that's okay...
calling on me without a reason...

124
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:52,412
It's okay for you to
hang around in front of me,

125
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:56,816
and if I do anything that upsets you,
you can hit me like you just did.

126
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,118
<i>Could this possibly mean...</i>

127
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:02,488
<i>he's trying to apologize</i>
<i>about what happened today?</i>

128
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:05,825
<i>Is that the reason why he is here?</i>

129
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:08,161
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>there was that other time...</i>

130
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:09,595
<i>That other time,</i>

131
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:12,498
<i>when he might have been trying</i>
<i>to apologize for hurting me...</i>

132
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:14,500
A- ahem...

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,769
I'm sorry, that wasn't it!

134
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,505
The reason I hit you with my bag is
because I mistook you for a molester!

135
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:20,506
Molester?

136
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:23,443
So you see, it's not
that I was upset at you!

137
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:25,111
Quite the contrary, I...

138
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:27,113
...like you!

139
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:30,783
I like the Cat from the zodiac!

140
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:35,455
That is to say, um,
I... want to be friends!

141
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:40,484
<i>If there were one, what would you do?</i>
<i>A girl who says she likes you?</i>

142
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:45,465
There isn't anything good about the Cat!

143
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:47,263
Let's hurry up and go home.

144
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:56,142
<i>I've started to somewhat</i>
<i>understand Kyo-kun.</i>

145
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,711
<i>He's a little more awkward than others,</i>

146
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:02,148
<i>but he's certainly a</i>
<i>good person deep down.</i>

147
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:06,381
<i>He's a gentle person, who</i>
<i>knows when he feels sorry.</i>

148
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:10,923
Yesterday, you know,

149
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:14,494
Kyo-<i>kun</i> said he was going to go
pick up Tohru-<i>kun</i> on his own!

150
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,163
Kyo-<i>kun</i>, you pervert!

151
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:19,165
How do you figure that!?

152
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:22,769
Yesterday was special. I won't do
it again! It'll never happen again!

153
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,340
Right. I'm just happy
that you're having your meal.

154
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,139
How is it? Is it to your liking?

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,448
--What!?
--Nothing.

156
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:36,783
You were looking at me, weren't you!?

157
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,117
Only looking, right?

158
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:40,453
Why would you look at me for no reason?

159
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:41,454
Do you not like it?

160
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,615
I hate it!

161
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:58,137
Let's play Rich Man, Poor Man!

162
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:01,808
Why don't you tell Yuki to? Damn Yuki!

163
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:04,811
If you're running away from
a fight, then you're no man!

164
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,145
How pathetic!

165
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:08,481
I accept your challenge to this fight!

166
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,483
You're going to be sorry
you did that, Yankee!

167
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:15,183
Why should I? Whoever loses has to take
on the cleaning chores for everyone here!

168
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:19,158
What a pleasant maelstrom of vibes...!

169
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:24,392
Let's invite Sohma-<i>kun</i> this time around,
too! Where do you suppose he's gone?

170
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:33,106
Sorry. Right now, I don't feel like
seeing anybody, so I have to say--

171
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:37,100
No! I don't want to hear it! Yuki-<i>kun</i>!

172
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:45,451
I, uh...

173
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,582
Yuki-<i>kun</i>, you are nice...

174
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,461
...but there's something
about you that rejects others.

175
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:59,232
Everyone says so!
"Yuki-<i>kun</i> is 'special'," they say.

176
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:03,294
"An 'ordinary' girl isn't good
enough to match up with Yuki-<i>kun."</i>

177
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,141
"Revolution!"

178
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:11,477
Why, you! What kind of dirty tricks
are you pulling, you rotten boy!?

179
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,146
That's how the rules go!

180
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:16,149
Let's see, a Revolution makes
the strong cards weak, so...

181
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,814
Special move--Reverse Revolution!

182
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:24,490
--You've had it now, Sohma!
--Nice going, Hanajima-<i>san</i>!

183
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,159
Whoa, how embarrassing!

184
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,527
Shut up, you guys!
This game's just getting started!

185
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:36,196
<i>Yuki-kun, there's something</i>
<i>about you that rejects others.</i>

186
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,514
Rich Man, Poor Man, huh?

187
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:51,851
I know the rules, but I've never played.

188
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:56,522
I just learned how to play
from Uo-<i>chan</i> myself.

189
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:58,524
Next time, let's play it together!

190
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:02,862
So, he was the Poor Man today, then?

191
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:04,864
Um, we'll help you, too!

192
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,532
No! My loss is my loss.

193
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:07,867
But...

194
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,869
Next time, though, I'm
going to win for sure!

195
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,537
And of course, I will beat you too!

196
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:14,540
Don't you get tired of
always saying that?

197
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,543
It is my conviction to win
against you! My objective!

198
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:21,214
And having you always badgering me
with it is my annoyance! My misfortune!

199
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:24,483
Your attitude of looking down
upon others makes me sick!

200
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:28,487
Your overly simplistic way
of thinking makes me sick.

201
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,989
<i>They're fighting again.</i>

202
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:36,162
<i>They get along worse than just being</i>
<i>Rat-san and Cat-san accounts for.</i>

203
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,497
<i>Come to think of it, there</i>
<i>was that time earlier...</i>

204
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:42,835
I will win against you, and
become a member of the Sohmas!

205
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:47,006
<i>Could those words indeed mean</i>
<i>that if Kyo-kun beats Sohma-kun,</i>

206
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:51,844
<i>he will be allowed to join the zodiac?</i>

207
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:53,512
<i>In other words...</i>

208
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:57,516
<i>In other words, Cat-san will be included,</i>
<i>and the Twelve will become Thirteen!</i>

209
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,518
<i>That would be wonderful!</i>

210
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:02,188
Damn you! I'll pulverize you!

211
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:05,524
However, fighting will not do. Not at all.

212
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:06,859
Um, Kyo-<i>kun--</i>

213
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:09,727
Prepare yourself, you cold-blooded rat!

214
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,237
Just looking at you gets on my nerves!

215
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:24,637
Sohma-<i>kun...</i>

216
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:29,873
Damn it all...

217
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:34,113
Why can't I beat him?

218
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:40,286
Today's move was a particularly
rough one. He must be in a bad mood.

219
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:52,471
<i>As much as Sohma-kun is</i>
<i>considerate towards others,</i>

220
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:57,705
<i>he may be the kind of person who keeps</i>
<i>his own feelings shut up inside him.</i>

221
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:07,920
Say, guess what? There's this
incredibly good-looking kid outside.

222
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,189
I wonder, is it a boy or a girl?

223
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,859
Oh my, how very lowbrow!

224
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,088
Could that be...?

225
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:19,597
Sohma-<i>kun</i>!

226
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,468
Hey there! What a hard worker you are!

227
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:26,138
D- did you come all the
way just to pick me up?

228
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:30,476
Mm-hm. This is a dangerous
time for girls, and all.

229
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:36,143
Thank you very much! Sohma-<i>kun,</i>
you and Kyo-<i>kun</i> are both kind!

230
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,950
Well, shall we go?

231
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,825
S- Sohma-<i>kun</i>...!

232
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:50,996
Um, if there's anything
gloomy weighing on your mind,

233
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:54,500
please tell me about it, okay.

234
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,735
When you have a bad dream,

235
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,503
they say it brings good luck
to talk to someone, and all.

236
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,506
So if I'm okay with you, and you want
to stamp that gloom out, I don't m--!

237
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:04,844
Hey, there! Don't go hangin'
'round here, get on home, youngsters!

238
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:08,848
?I can' go back to my house at all...??

239
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:16,856
...I don't mind, but maybe I'm just
adding to your gloom instead...

240
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:21,021
No. It's my fault for
having this nature about me.

241
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:29,101
When I was at my parents' house,

242
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:32,805
it was like I was in a cage, being kept
watched on by the main house and Akito.

243
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:37,443
I was surrounded by ordinary people,
and yearned for an ordinary life.

244
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:42,815
That's why I left the house and
began going to a coed high school.

245
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:46,819
However, as it turns out,
I haven't left the cage at all.

246
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,688
I'm still living in a
Sohma's house, same as before,

247
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:53,492
and I can't associate
with others very well.

248
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,094
It's not that I...

249
00:15:55,094 --> 00:16:00,795
mean to reject others, but there's
something about me that's awkward.

250
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:07,006
And since I'm like this, I can't
escape my feelings of inferiority,

251
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:08,507
or my being frightened.

252
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:13,078
But Kyo is different. He may not take
well to those who he's unfamiliar with,

253
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:15,514
but I think once you get to know him,

254
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,516
he's the type of person
that draws others in.

255
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,719
Even if he can't
become one of the zodiac,

256
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:25,791
I think it's better for one to be able to
naturally get along with ordinary people.

257
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,796
I wanted to be like that too.

258
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,732
That's why it gets on my nerves.

259
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:37,470
When I see for myself how
Kyo wants to join the Sohmas...

260
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,474
I wonder what it is about me
that wants to leave there.

261
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,811
Sohma-<i>kun</i>, you too have the
power to draw people in.

262
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:50,483
So many girls say they like
you, and that you're nice.

263
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,486
I'm only nice because I
want to be liked by them.

264
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:59,492
It's like I'm giving them candy because
I want to be in their circle of friends.

265
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:05,164
I'm only being nice for my own
sake. Maybe that's hypocritical...

266
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,325
So--

267
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:15,508
This was sure sudden. There was
nothing in the weather forecast about it.

268
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:17,500
This is terrible!

269
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,180
Sohma-<i>kun</i>...!

270
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,117
What's so terrible?

271
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:26,452
A farm?

272
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:29,788
It's more like a family vegetable garden.

273
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,790
Sohma-<i>kun</i>, you did this?

274
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,460
Mm-hmm. This is my secret base.

275
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,129
This is wonderful! I get it now!

276
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:40,132
You have to protect the base from
this harsh wind and rain, right?

277
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:43,802
I'll do whatever little
I can to help you out!

278
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:47,139
Honda-<i>san</i>, you sure are kind!

279
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,841
Ah, you can't mean it!

280
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:52,144
This is the first time I've ever had
anyone say that to me! I'm so happy!

281
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,880
Ah, but what if I too
am being hypocritical,

282
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,482
and only doing this so I will
look like a good person to others?

283
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,484
No, Honda-<i>san</i>, I
think it's in your nature.

284
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:03,489
Still, my mother always said it's
better to believe than to doubt.

285
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:07,159
People aren't born with kindness,
you know, she would say.

286
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:13,198
Things like our appetites, or material
desires--that's what we're all born with.

287
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:16,502
It just means that they
are instinctive for living.

288
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:20,139
Kindness is something that
develops, just like our bodies do,

289
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:25,444
and the heart that grows inside
us is our conscience, she'd say.

290
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:29,814
That's why it takes on different
forms, depending on the person.

291
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:36,789
<i>Desire is something that everyone is</i>
<i>born with, so it's easy to comprehend.</i>

292
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:41,794
<i>But kindness is like something which</i>
<i>people have to hand-make for themselves,</i>

293
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:46,799
<i>so it is easily misunderstood, or</i>
<i>taken to be hypocrisy, you see.</i>

294
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,767
<i>When I heard that,</i>

295
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:52,671
<i>I was excited to think that people</i>
<i>had kindnesses that were of different</i>

296
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:57,142
<i>shapes--like they</i>
<i>could be round, or pointy.</i>

297
00:18:57,142 --> 00:19:03,482
Sohma-<i>kun</i>, your kindness is like a
candle. Your light shines brightly.

298
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:07,486
When it does, I become
happy, and want to smile.

299
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,489
Ah, a candle must seem
pretty weird, doesn't it?

300
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,891
Mm-mm! It's just--I'm really pathetic.

301
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:15,494
Here I am a guy, yet the way I
was going on about everything...

302
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:21,166
I'm happy you did. Sohma-<i>kun</i>, for you to
tell me so many things about yourself,

303
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,228
I feel that we are getting
along that much better.

304
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:34,113
Excuse me! I will continue
with my duty to protect the base!

305
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:40,786
<i>Doubting is easy, it's something all</i>
<i>of us can do. Tohru, you believe.</i>

306
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:45,124
<i>Become the kind of girl</i>
<i>who can believe in others.</i>

307
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:51,121
<i>That will surely...</i>
<i>surely lend strength to someone.</i>

308
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:57,136
We defended it to the last!

309
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:59,805
But we came out of it pretty ragged.

310
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,474
Is there anything that looks
ready to pick right now?

311
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:04,810
Perhaps the leeks are ready to be eaten.

312
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,811
Leeks?

313
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,479
<i>Leeks... leeks...</i>

314
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,148
Honda-<i>san...</i>

315
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:13,485
Next time, I'll give
Rich Man, Poor Man a try.

316
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:17,489
By all means! But I thought
you weren't interested in it.

317
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:25,761
Mm-mm. It's just that it is so noisy,
I felt hesitant. But I will try.

318
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,102
Little by little is okay, but I will
get better at socializing with people.

319
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:33,872
It'll be all right! Hana-<i>chan</i>
and Uo-<i>chan</i> are very good people.

320
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,108
They are the friends
that I can take pride in!

321
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:38,410
Besides, Sohma-<i>kun</i>, you
seem like you'd be good at it,

322
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,114
everyone will be delighted
over a new challenge!

323
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,913
Yeah. I'm not going to give in!

324
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:57,062
<i>I got the feeling that this was the</i>
<i>first time I saw Sohma-kun really smile.</i>

325
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,471
Thank you for waiting!

326
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:07,139
I hate leeks!

327
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:10,142
And not just leeks either, right?
You hate onions and miso too, right?

328
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,478
If the miso is in miso
soup, that's no problem!

329
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:17,610
I did not know that. I'm sorry. I will
hurry and fix some other dish, okay?

330
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:20,945
Eat!

331
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:27,493
<i>Maybe there isn't anything that can be</i>
<i>done about how badly they get along.</i>

332
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:29,528
<i>However, could it be possible</i>

333
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:34,166
<i>that there's something about</i>
<i>Sohma-kun that appeals to Kyo?</i>

334
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,503
Yuki-<i>kun</i>, Kyo-<i>kun</i> is unconscious already.

335
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,772
<i>If they could understand</i>
<i>that about each other,</i>

336
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:42,841
<i>they would get along better, maybe...</i>

337
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:46,845
<i>I... guess I just</i>
<i>misunderstood you. I'm sorry.</i>

338
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:51,715
<i>Me too. Let's go on, forever</i>
<i>deepening our friendship!</i>

339
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:56,182
<i>Somehow, that's scary too!</i>

340
00:21:56,787 --> 00:22:06,786
<i>Now let us circle together,</i>
<i>around a pleasant dinner.</i>

341
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:16,796
<i>Come, take today's tears, and</i>
<i>make them tomorrow's strength.</i>

342
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:23,146
<i>La, la, la...</i>

343
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:29,152
<i>Wonderful love and life</i>

344
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:34,491
<i>La, la, la...</i>

345
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:40,163
<i>Adorable love and life</i>

346
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:45,502
<i>La, la, la...</i>

347
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:49,200
<i>Wonderful love and life</i>

348
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:22,638
On the next Fruits Basket
Episode 4...

349
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:25,308
<i>My name is Sohma Kagura.</i>

350
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:29,979
<i>Sohma Kagura-san? What a cute girl!</i>


351
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:35,318
<i>In fact, Kagura has kept saying she</i>
<i>would marry Kyo since she was little.</i>


352
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:38,321
<i>Right. Kagura-san is incredible.</i>

353
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:40,790
<i>When she's here, things go badly for me.</i>

354
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,992
<i>She never, ever</i>
<i>understands what's going on.</i>

355
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:47,726
<i>I think it's amazing that someone</i>
<i>could come to like someone else so much.</i>
