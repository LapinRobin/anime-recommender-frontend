00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:17,139
<i>I was so very happy</i>
<i>when you smiled at me,</i>

2
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:23,079
<i>A smile that melted everything away.</i>

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:30,586
<i>Spring is still far away,</i>
<i>and within the cold ground,</i>

4
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:36,125
<i>I awaited the time when</i>
<i>sprouts would put forth their buds.</i>

5
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,528
<i>Even supposing today there</i>
<i>may have been some pain,</i>

6
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:43,199
<i>And though the scars of yesterday remain,</i>

7
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:50,039
<i>You can go on living as much</i>
<i>as your heart wants to believe.</i>

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,409
<i>You cannot be born again, although</i>

9
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:57,847
<i>You can go on changing yourself, and so</i>

10
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>Let's stay together, always.</i>

11
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:28,477
This is terrible!
This is terrible!

12
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:32,814
Mailman-<i>san</i>, this is terrible!
Everyone is an animal!

13
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:36,151
Yes, they're animals, all
right. Here's your mail.

14
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,313
I mean, not like that...!

15
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,491
Such a very bright dog, isn't he?

16
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:45,827
Very well, then...

17
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,329
For the love of...!

18
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,831
With you guys having changed
too, no excuse will work!

19
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,834
You're the one that blew it
first, you know. Stupid cat.

20
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,170
Stupid cat!? Go ahead and
try saying that again!

21
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,505
Stupid cat!

22
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,106
Why, you bastard!

23
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,841
That's enough, already!

24
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:03,512
<i>They can even speak the language...!</i>

25
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:07,516
It's no use. Rather than cover this up
poorly, I'll just go ahead and tell you.

26
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:10,919
Tohru-<i>kun</i>, what it comes down
to is that I have the Dog,

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,522
Yuki-<i>kun</i> has the Rat, and him...

28
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:18,193
Sohma Kyo has the spirit
of the Cat possessing him.

29
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,862
Spirits?

30
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:25,133
Yeah. The people of the House of
Sohma, for many hundreds of years,

31
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:28,136
have had the same spirits that
are in the zodiac possessing us.

32
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:32,471
And well, the Cat, in a sense,
would be the exception, I guess.

33
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:36,144
So, when our bodies grow weak,
and for some reason,

34
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:39,147
when we are embraced by the opposite
sex, it's enough to make us transform.

35
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:42,484
After some time passes, we
return back to normal on our own.

36
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:45,153
However...

37
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:48,156
...we'll be completely naked.

38
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,159
I'm sorry you had to see
something so unpleasant.

39
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,164
Yeah... Although, I'm beginning
to grasp most of the information.

40
00:02:56,164 --> 00:02:59,067
<i>For them to be possessed</i>
<i>by spirits of the zodiac,</i>

41
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:02,437
<i>I have learned an incredible secret.</i>

42
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,841
<i>Sohma-kun didn't want this to be known,</i>

43
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:08,510
<i>so that's why he thrust away</i>
<i>that 2nd-year upperclassman</i>

44
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,513
<i>who was coming to hug him, huh?</i>

45
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:15,183
Tohru-<i>kun</i>, you said you
wanted to be a Cat, right?

46
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,518
Y- yes.

47
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:19,855
Now that you've actually met
the real one, what do you think?

48
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,523
<i>That's right.</i>

49
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:23,792
<i>That person is the Cat-san!</i>

50
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,994
But Kyo is such a fool!

51
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:28,430
When someone with that much
knowledge of martial arts

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,465
can be taken from behind
that easily, what can he do?

53
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,467
That was embarrassing. Embarrassing!

54
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,469
At least he should have been
able to read your presence.

55
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:37,706
I wonder how he's going to take
responsibility for this situation.

56
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,776
Really, that boy can't see
anything besides Yuki-<i>kun.</i>

57
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:41,810
What will we do with him?

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,445
Don't make it sound so funny!

59
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:45,480
I couldn't help it if I didn't notice her!

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,151
And why is she even... what's a
girl doing in this house anyway!?

61
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,819
Shut up!

62
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,123
Whether there's a girl in this
house or not is irrelevant to you.

63
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:58,160
You are an "outsider," after all.

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,253
You shut up!

65
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,836
Tohru-<i>kun</i>, you're bleeding!

66
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:09,838
Bleeding!?

67
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:13,842
--So--
--I knew he was stupid, but not this bad.

68
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:19,181
In light of your stupidity, today I
will specially take you like I mean it.

69
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,516
Don't you bore me.

70
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,452
Fine, you girly-boy!

71
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:24,453
Sohma-<i>kun</i>!

72
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,121
Don't worry about them.

73
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:29,458
Those two are on volatile
terms with each other.

74
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,460
Whenever the two see each
other, all they do is fight.

75
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,129
Um, but still, we have to stop them!

76
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,998
It's okay. This will be
settled soon enough anyhow.

77
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:50,812
I thought I told you not to bore me.

78
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:53,148
H- he went flying...

79
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:55,817
Yuki-<i>kun</i>, don't you go
smashing up the house, too.

80
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,086
I didn't think he was
going to fly so far.

81
00:04:58,086 --> 00:05:00,489
His guard wasn't cutting it, perhaps?

82
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:02,157
Honda-san,

83
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,158
are you hurt?

84
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,495
I- I'm completely, utterly fine!

85
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:09,831
But, what about him?

86
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:13,168
I bet he's all right... probably...

87
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:17,506
Tohru-<i>kun</i>, looking at Kyo, your dreams
about the Cat must be shattered, right?

88
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:20,509
Not at all!

89
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:21,772
Um...

90
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:30,051
<i>I've made another discovery.</i>

91
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:33,789
<i>I never knew that the person we</i>
<i>called the Prince was so strong.</i>

92
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,959
<i>I knew he was good all-around at sports,</i>
<i>but that was separate from this.</i>

93
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,462
<i>There was a gap between this and school--</i>

94
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:41,463
School!!

95
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:43,799
I- I'm going to be t- t- tardy!

96
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:47,803
School? But your uniform is filthy!

97
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,806
See? You were digging around in it
out back just yesterday, after all.

98
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:54,476
That's all right! I'll just say that
I fell down! That will be perfect!

99
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,144
No, I don't think that will work.

100
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:59,481
I'm sorry, but I want to be
sure to at least go to school.

101
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,485
You promised your late mother
you would, after all, right?

102
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:05,020
But before anything else,

103
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,156
you'll have to let me inform
Akito-<i>san</i> about all this.

104
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:09,825
Akito-<i>san</i>?

105
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,828
Yeah. He's the head of the House of Sohma.

106
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:17,465
The family... head?

107
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:18,867
Then he's somebody important.

108
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:25,106
Yes, and the Sohma's greatest secret
has just been found out, after all.

109
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:28,702
I see. Well, I'm off.

110
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:32,781
Come back soon.

111
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:37,118
Here I thought you were
going on and on about us...

112
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:41,289
You were just intending to erase
Honda-<i>san</i>'s memories anyway.

113
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,780
Like so long ago...

114
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,262
That's not my intention.

115
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:52,801
Back then, it was found out by a lot
of people, so there was no choice.

116
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:55,270
I'm going to school.

117
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,145
Thank goodness, I was able
to borrow a washing machine.

118
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:08,776
Those clothes were awful!
How did you fall down?

119
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:16,618
L - O - V- E, Lovely Yuki!

120
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:21,429
Oh, Honda-<i>san</i>, you washed?

121
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:24,422
And here being covered with
mud suited you so much better.

122
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:32,774
The prince-<i>sama</i> also came late today.

123
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:35,543
The Prince Yuki gang has been
getting strangely suspicious.

124
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:37,779
Their brains sure are unoccupied.

125
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,450
<i>I didn't dare tell Uo-chan and</i>
<i>Hana-chan, who worry so much after me,</i>

126
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,120
<i>that I was staying at Sohma-kun's house.</i>

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,457
I- I'm going to go change my
clothes in the locker room.

128
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:50,725
Girls' Locker Room

129
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:53,461
Honda-<i>san...</i>

130
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,797
Sohma-<i>kun</i>...?

131
00:07:55,797 --> 00:08:01,803
You haven't said anything, right?
To your friends, about us?

132
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:03,471
No, I haven't said anything.

133
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,441
By any chance, am I making you uneasy?

134
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,310
I would never say anything!

135
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,147
Mother often told me that only
bad people are gabby about others!

136
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:14,149
--No, that's not it...
--I give you my oath!

137
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,751
I'll seal it in blood, or burn
it into my skin! I'll do anything!

138
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,486
Mother used to do this long ago.

139
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:22,424
That's not what I mean!

140
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:25,427
I'm sorry, okay?

141
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:29,798
You're trying so
kindly to keep our secret,

142
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:33,633
but it may turn out that
your memories will be erased.

143
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:39,875
I say erased, but
it's more like hypnotism.

144
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:49,117
<i>A long time ago, you see, the</i>
<i>secret got out, like it did today.</i>

145
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:52,153
<i>When I was seven years old,</i>

146
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:55,282
<i>I was playing in the</i>
<i>yard at my parents' house.</i>

147
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,966
<i>In the end, it became a fuss</i>
<i>where every child that was there</i>

148
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,959
<i>had to have their memories erased.</i>

149
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,478
<i>Akito, am I strange?</i>

150
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:20,677
<i>Strange enough that you have</i>
<i>to so desperately hide this?</i>

151
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,420
<i>Mm-hmm. You are strange.</i>

152
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,759
<i>Any human that can transform into</i>
<i>a rat would have to be strange.</i>

153
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,831
<i>If regular people were to know</i>
<i>about this, it would sicken them.</i>

154
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:39,426
<i>They will distance themselves from you...</i>

155
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:47,108
Sohma-<i>kun</i>?

156
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,110
Are you all right?

157
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,446
Mm-hmm.

158
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:57,318
I cannot go against what Akito decides.

159
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:01,456
Whatever he determines, I
cannot do anything about it.

160
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:04,125
That's why... I'm sorry!

161
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,491
Uh, wait!

162
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:17,472
I'm so sorr~y! That wasn't-- that
wasn't on purpose! Oh, I am such a fool!

163
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:21,476
It's okay. Nobody saw me.

164
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:25,080
Right. Um...

165
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,084
Thank you for being
so concerned about me.

166
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:36,091
I'm happy, very much so.
I'll be all right. No problem.

167
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,593
If I've found out a secret so serious

168
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:41,229
that the head of the family
must be contacted about it,

169
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,765
then I don't think there's
anything else that can be done.

170
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:46,601
So please, go ahead and use
whatever methods will give you

171
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:49,771
and the others the most
piece of mind, Sohma-<i>kun.</i>

172
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:54,509
<i>Forgetting about this does,</i>
<i>of course, make me sad.</i>

173
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:59,447
<i>However, I'm very happy that</i>
<i>they accepted me unconditionally,</i>

174
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,450
<i>after living in a tent,</i>
<i>so I can put up with it.</i>

175
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,479
After my memory gets erased,
please be my friend again, okay?

176
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:15,797
Sorry. The time it takes to
return to normal is irregular.

177
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:17,823
N- not at all...

178
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:25,140
Sohma-<i>kun</i>, your necktie is crooked.

179
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,809
I'm just not very good
at this sort of thing.

180
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:31,479
Somehow, I wouldn't have expected that.

181
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:34,881
I guess I'm on now, huh?

182
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:40,388
<i>If regular people were to know</i>
<i>about this, it would sicken them.</i>

183
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:43,483
<i>They will distance themselves from you...</i>

184
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,829
Honda-<i>san</i>, you don't feel sickened?

185
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,832
No! Thanks to you,
I'm feeling completely better!

186
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,733
No, that's not what I mean...

187
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:00,508
Today, how about we go home together?

188
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:01,874
Okay!

189
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:08,677
Please be my friend again, okay?

190
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,487
Thanks.

191
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:20,655
Not at all! Tying neckties is
one of the things I'm good at!

192
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:42,814
I will put my trust in this Tohru-<i>san.</i>

193
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:50,058
For Yuki... for Kyo...
and for myself as well,

194
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:52,721
this may be a good opportunity.

195
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:57,832
I'm home!

196
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:00,131
We just got home!

197
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:06,841
Shigure? He has gone out.

198
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:08,843
I'm going to go put by bag away, okay?

199
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,072
Okay.

200
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:23,791
--U- um...
--It's just a temporary
measure, all right?

201
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,427
Call a professional
later and have him fix it.

202
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,129
As long as you're out of the
rain, that'll be fine, right?

203
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,995
Y- yes.

204
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:36,471
<i>Now that I've finally met the Cat-san,</i>
<i>I feel as though he dislikes me.</i>

205
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,140
--Hey.
--Y- yes!?

206
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,146
I... can't see what's around
me... when I lose my temper.

207
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:48,149
I didn't have enough training!

208
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:51,819
And I lost to that damn Yuki and all...

209
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:58,493
And so... about this
morning... about this morning...

210
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:02,830
--I apologi--
--I'm home! Yuki-<i>kun,</i>
Tohru-<i>kun</i>, I just got back!

211
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,833
You too, you stupid, bungling,
lost-another-fight Kyo-<i>kun</i>!

212
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,168
Never mind, dammit!

213
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:08,836
U- um...!

214
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,964
Um, Cat-<i>san...</i>

215
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:15,843
He'll be back soon. He has
nowhere to go, after all.

216
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,513
More importantly, Tohru-<i>kun,</i>
do you have a minute?

217
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:20,209
Y- yes...

218
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:27,320
I've just been to Akito-<i>san</i>'s place.

219
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:35,129
He said that so long as she
keeps our secret, Tohru-<i>kun</i>
can live together with us.

220
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:37,799
No punishment... then?

221
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,801
Punishment?

222
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,470
In return, you are to
strictly keep our secret, okay?

223
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,472
Yes!

224
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:48,034
<i>Terrific! I will not lose my memory!</i>

225
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:59,821
Shigure...

226
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:03,825
Isn't this somehow too good to be true?

227
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:07,495
Akito wouldn't be planning
something, would he?

228
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:13,000
I wonder. Look, why don't we
just trust Akito-<i>san</i> on this?

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,504
After all, things are going so well.

230
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:18,840
Ahem...

231
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,643
Um, it may be strange to say this
again, but I'm pleased to meet you,

232
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:26,781
and thank you for all your trouble.

233
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:30,451
Uh, right. Pleased to meet you, too.

234
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,787
Pleased to meet you, Tohru-<i>kun.</i>

235
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:33,982
Right!

236
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:47,797
<i>Mother, in any event, I, Tohru, have</i>
<i>come to stay at the Sohmas' house.</i>

237
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,158
With the place this awful,
I've got my fighting spirit up!

238
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,493
I'll help you. What should I do?

239
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,828
You should stop right there.

240
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:17,565
Yuki-<i>kun</i> is so maladroit, he can't
even fold a paper crane properly.

241
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,167
He'll just slow you down.

242
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,169
Just leave all of this
to me, if you please!

243
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:23,805
I'm more than grateful to
perform household chores

244
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,606
in exchange for free rent.

245
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:28,443
That's why it's at times like this
when I want to be of most service.

246
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,945
Well then, we shall take you up on it.

247
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:33,781
I'll go look for Kyo and grab him,
then we have to leave for a bit.

248
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,450
We'll be back sometime this afternoon.

249
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,785
Sure, that will be fine!

250
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:40,455
Well then, maybe I'll
go out for a bit as well.

251
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:43,458
Okay. All of you, come back soon, then.

252
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,795
Or so I said... This really is awful...

253
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,764
Honda Tohru will do her best!

254
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:01,943
Whew! Finished!

255
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:08,149
Incredible! It's amazing that
you could make a kitchen as
nasty as this one so clean!

256
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,485
You mean we had a rice
cooker in this house?

257
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,487
I unearthed it.

258
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:15,980
Breakfast--or by now,
it's lunch--is ready!

259
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:22,430
Delicious.

260
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,099
Really? It doesn't need more seasoning?

261
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,436
It's just right! It's been some
time since I had a meal like this.

262
00:17:28,436 --> 00:17:30,104
That's good.

263
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,339
Come to think of it,

264
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:34,108
where do you suppose Shigure
and that stupid cat went off to?

265
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:37,111
He said they would be back this afternoon.

266
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:41,139
Doesn't really matter. It's just that
a nice meal such as this will get cold.

267
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:46,454
<i>There was something wondrous about it.</i>

268
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:51,792
<i>Here I was facing Sohma-kun,</i>
<i>and sharing a meal...</i>

269
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:57,131
Um, Sohma-<i>kun</i>, you stepped out earlier
yourself, right? Did you go shopping?

270
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:00,801
Yeah. For my secret base in the backyard.

271
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,803
Secret base?

272
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:06,140
Secret base? Wow!
It's making my heart pound!

273
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,810
I imagine it's probably different
from what you're thinking.

274
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,480
If you want, I'll invite
you along next time.

275
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,483
Will that be all right!?
I'm so happy! A secret base!

276
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:17,752
When I was little, there
was one in our neighborhood,

277
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:19,487
but we were told that
girls weren't allowed in!

278
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,489
Ah! How delightful!

279
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,758
Look, just listen to
what I'm saying, Kyo!

280
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:24,725
Shut up!

281
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,761
Do you enjoy rolling people around
in the palm of your hand like this!?

282
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,029
Now wait there!

283
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,430
You asked me if I enjoy it,
and although I do like it quite a bit,

284
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,765
it's for your own good!

285
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:33,434
Besides which, it's what
Akito-san has determined.

286
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,770
Cram it! Who cares
about that damn Akito!?

287
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,773
U- um, welcome back.
Would you like some lunch?

288
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:39,774
Don't want any!

289
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:42,376
Kyo! Don't take
this out on Tohru-<i>kun</i>!

290
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:45,112
And come in through the front
door! And take off your shoes!

291
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,448
Shigure, you've got no room to argue.

292
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:50,117
This is the first time I've seen
you wear a suit. It's most befitting.

293
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:51,452
It is? I wonder...

294
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,120
You look like you're hosting something.

295
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,122
Ah, food is ready!

296
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:57,458
Yes, but what about Kyo-<i>san</i>?

297
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,127
Ah, that? He's upset,
so just leave him alone.

298
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,797
I tricked him into taking the
transfer student entrance exam.

299
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,132
The transfer student entrance exam?

300
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:10,471
What I mean is, Kyo-<i>kun</i> will now begin
going to the same high school as you two.

301
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:13,474
What's more, he will also be living
together with us in this house.

302
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:16,477
No eating! Stay back! Get out!

303
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:19,914
Well, yeah, I figured you'd
be angry, and sure enough...

304
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:26,410
Kyo, you see, had disappeared
for more than four months.

305
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,758
Where do you think he's been?

306
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,094
He's been training up in
the mountains, I'm told.

307
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:35,096
Training?

308
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:39,329
Being beaten upon by waterfalls, and
dueling with bears--that kind of training?

309
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:43,437
Mmm, well, that was
the impression, I guess.

310
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:46,566
Kyo-<i>kun</i> wants quite badly
to beat Yuki-<i>kun</i>, see?

311
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,971
He's an idiot.

312
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:54,949
<i>Could it be that Kyo-san's</i>
<i>wanting to win that badly</i>

313
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:59,987
<i>is indeed like it is in the zodiac fables,</i>

314
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:05,517
<i>where the Cat-san resents</i>
<i>the Rat-san for tricking him?</i>

315
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:12,795
<i>However, I get the feeling that it's</i>
<i>not fair to Kyo-san to be asking that.</i>

316
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,743
Where, where? Where is he?

317
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:27,081
Over there! The kid with
the orange head! How cute!

318
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,749
Still, he's doesn't look the same!

319
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,084
Say, you there...

320
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,752
Are you really Sohma-<i>kun</i>'s cousin?

321
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,813
Do you get along well with Sohma-<i>kun</i>?

322
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:39,427
Kyo-<i>san</i> is getting scared.

323
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:41,429
It's the same...

324
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,099
I sense the same vibe from
that kid as I do from Sohma Yuki.

325
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:49,770
What is that? What presence is it?
It's a vibe different from a person's...

326
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,773
That's rude, you know.

327
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,442
Hold up...

328
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:57,445
I hear that guy is your cousin?

329
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:03,117
We may be cousins, but we aren't close.
I've never even spoken to him.

330
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:05,786
Hold on, where are you going?

331
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,846
Say, wait up!

332
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,125
Yow! Ow!

333
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,461
Kyo-- I mean, Sohma-<i>kun</i>, er...!

334
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:14,462
Let me go!

335
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:15,796
Hold on! Calm down!

336
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:18,425
Leave me alone!

337
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:22,803
No way!

338
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,806
Incredible! That's what I'd expect
from Sohma-<i>kun</i>'s cousin, all right!

339
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,141
But this is the second floor!

340
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:31,602
It hurt! And I'm a girl! How cruel!

341
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,482
Who jumps down like that, ordinarily?

342
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:37,782
He's not a cat, is he?

343
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,154
Kyo-<i>san...</i>

344
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:49,497
<i>Mother, Kyo-san is indeed the Cat-san.</i>

345
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:55,630
<i>I wonder if I will ever</i>
<i>become friends with Kyo-san.</i>

346
00:21:56,804 --> 00:22:06,803
<i>Now let us circle together,</i>
<i>around a pleasant dinner.</i>

347
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:16,813
<i>Come, take today's tears, and</i>
<i>make them tomorrow's strength.</i>

348
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:23,163
<i>La, la, la...</i>

349
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:29,169
<i>Wonderful love and life</i>

350
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:34,508
<i>La, la, la...</i>

351
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:40,180
<i>Adorable love and life</i>

352
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,519
<i>La, la, la...</i>

353
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,217
<i>Wonderful love and life</i>

354
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:22,655
On the next Fruits Basket
Episode 3...

355
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:25,892
<i>I will win!</i>
<i>I will surely win against you!</i>

356
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:29,329
<i>I will win against you, and become</i>
<i>a formal member of the Sohmas!</i>

357
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,333
<i>If there were one, what would you do?</i>
<i>A girl who says she likes you?</i>

358
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,669
<i>There'll never be anyone like that.</i>

359
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:39,172
<i>That's why it gets on my nerves.</i>

360
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:42,976
<i>When I see for myself how</i>
<i>Kyo wants to join the Sohmas.</i>

361
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:47,971
<i>If there's gloomy weighing on your</i>
<i>mind, please tell me about it, okay?</i>
