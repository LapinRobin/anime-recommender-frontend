00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:15,915
<i>I was so very happy</i>
<i>when you smiled at me,</i>

2
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:21,855
<i>A smile that melted everything away.</i>

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>Spring is still far away,</i>
<i>and within the cold ground,</i>

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,901
<i>I awaited the time when</i>
<i>sprouts would put forth their buds.</i>

5
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,304
<i>Even supposing today there</i>
<i>may have been some pain,</i>

6
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,975
<i>And though the scars of yesterday remain,</i>

7
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:48,815
<i>You can go on living as much</i>
<i>as your heart wants to believe.</i>

8
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,185
<i>You cannot be born again, although</i>

9
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,623
<i>You can go on changing yourself, and so</i>

10
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,755
<i>Let's stay together, always.</i>

11
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,317
It has cleared up completely!

12
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:33,926
Okay then, Mother, please
watch over things today, too.

13
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,594
<i>I'm off!</i>

14
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:38,931
<i>Pleased to meet you. I'm Honda Tohru.</i>

15
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,401
<i>In May of this year, my mother,</i>

16
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:46,105
<i>who had been raising me all alone,</i>
<i>was killed in a traffic accident.</i>

17
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>As a result, I am now</i>
<i>secretly living in a tent.</i>

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,046
<i>I can't say that it's an</i>
<i>easy life, but that's okay.</i>

19
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:59,618
<i>One of my virtues is that no matter</i>
<i>the times, I will not be discouraged.</i>

20
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,287
Huh?

21
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:06,625
<i>Mother, I've discovered something!</i>
<i>There is a house standing here.</i>

22
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,963
<i>It's has such a relaxed feel to it.</i>

23
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:14,967
<i>How cute!</i>
<i>Twelve ornaments, from the zodiac.</i>

24
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,458
Huh?

25
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:22,271
How can it be that there is a girl here?

26
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,581
P- pardon me!
I looked without asking first!

27
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,752
Go ahead, go ahead. I'm just
drying them in the sun, after all.

28
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,287
However, they couldn't
be that interesting

29
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,256
for such a young person to look at.

30
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:40,593
Not at all. They are very cute.

31
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:46,265
Really? In that case,
I'm happy. I like them too.

32
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:49,602
Still, just as I thought,
there is no cat, huh?

33
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,204
Cat? Ah...

34
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:55,941
Could it be you're referring to the cat
that appears in the tales of the zodiac?

35
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:56,609
Yes.

36
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,613
My mother told them to me quite often.

37
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:06,719
<i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>God told the animals,</i>

38
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,357
<i>"I invite you to come to the</i>
<i>banquet that I shall hold tomorrow.</i>

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,627
<i>Make sure not to be late."</i>

40
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,296
<i>When he heard that, the rat,</i>
<i>who liked to play pranks,</i>

41
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,098
Yes, sir,
yes, sir.
Is that clear?
<i>When he heard that, the rat,</i>
<i>who liked to play pranks,</i>

42
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,299
Yes, sir,
yes, sir.
Is that clear?
<i>lied to the cat who lived near him,</i>

43
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,802
Ho, thank you.
Yes, sir,
yes, sir.
Is that clear?
<i>lied to the cat who lived near him,</i>

44
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,235
Ho, thank you.
Yes, sir,
yes, sir.
Is that clear?
<i>saying that the banquet</i>
<i>was the day after next.</i>

45
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:26,272
<i>The next day, the rat rode upon the</i>
<i>ox's back before the banquet hall,</i>

46
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,574
Welcome to
the Banquet
<i>where he lightly jumped down.</i>

47
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,377
Welcome to
the Banquet
<i>After him came the ox,</i>
<i>the tiger, and so on.</i>

48
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,046
Welcome to
the Banquet
<i>The banquet was delightful,</i>
<i>and went on until morning.</i>

49
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:34,914
<i>The banquet was delightful,</i>
<i>and went on until morning.</i>

50
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:39,919
<i>Only the cat, who had been</i>
<i>tricked, was left out.</i>

51
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,921
<i>What are you crying about, Tohru?</i>

52
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,592
<i>I feel so sorry for him!</i>
<i>I feel so sorry for cat-san!</i>

53
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:50,596
<i>I've made up my mind! I'm giving up</i>
<i>Dog-san, and I will become Cat-san!</i>

54
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:54,934
Oh, yeah? I wonder what kind of
face he'll make when he hears that.

55
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,935
"He?"

56
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,138
So, you're the year of the Dog, then?
I'm feeling a sense of affinity.

57
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,274
You see, I, too am a Dog--

58
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:05,611
What are you flirting around here for?

59
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:10,282
Are you okay, Honda-<i>san</i>? My cousin
didn't do anything impolite, did he?

60
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,952
S- Sohma-<i>kun</i>!

61
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,522
<i>Mother, it doesn't seem real!</i>
<i>It's Sohma-kun!</i>

62
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,893
<i>The prince of my school, Sohma Yuki,</i>
<i>is standing before my eyes!</i>

63
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,395
--That's quite a heavy bag you've got.
<i>--Then this is Sohma Yuki-kun's house.</i>

64
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:24,563
You have a dictionary
or something in there?

65
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:26,794
Yeah, two of them.

66
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,908
Oh? So you're Yuki-<i>kun</i>'s classmate, then?

67
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:40,913
Then, from the top-- I am Sohma
Shigure, Yuki-<i>kun</i>'s cousin.

68
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,248
Honda Tohru.

69
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,584
Honda-<i>san</i>, what brings you to this area?

70
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,920
My house is, um, near.

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,588
Near? To here?

72
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:52,591
Y- yes...

73
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,927
W- well, with that, I should be--

74
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,262
Ah, Honda-<i>san...</i>

75
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,263
Yes?

76
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,199
Since you're already here,
shall we go together?

77
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:06,333
L - O - V- E, Lovely Yuki!

78
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,281
Honda-<i>san</i>!

79
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,949
What on earth was that about!?

80
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,684
Would you like to explain to us clearly

81
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,886
how you came to school
together with Sohma-<i>kun</i>?

82
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:22,555
I- It was an accident.

83
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,890
If you could get away with accidents,
we wouldn't need the police!

84
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,292
When it comes to Sohma-<i>kun,</i>
of 1st Year, Section D,

85
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,494
at Kaiwara High School,
there isn't a girl student around

86
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,229
who doesn't know how
he is so attractive--

87
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,231
--and clearheaded--
--both scholarly and athletic!

88
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:37,236
And yet he will not deign to let us, the
"Prince Yuki" fan club, come near him!

89
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,238
--Hey!
--What!?

90
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,907
Tohru said it was by accident, didn't she?

91
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,910
Don't go attaching any idiotic
pretexts to it, you hear?

92
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,245
Why, you!

93
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,915
You Yankees think that if you threaten
enough, you can get away with anything!

94
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:54,478
I will make you ------ with harmful vibes.

95
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,258
Uo-<i>chan</i>, Hana-<i>chan</i>, you saved me!

96
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,595
That was a disaster,
huh Tohru? There, there...

97
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,597
Hanajima, don't
seriously send out any vibes.

98
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,931
Cooking Room

99
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,167
Sohma-<i>kun</i> is overly attractive,

100
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,603
and just looking at him standing
next to me made me nervous.

101
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,939
I couldn't make any conversation with
him worth calling conversation, either.

102
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,943
I sense an unusual vibe from him...

103
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,879
Here it comes-- Hanajima's Vibe Report.

104
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,880
Unusual, you say?

105
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,216
I'm not quite sure about it.

106
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:27,553
Well, there certainly is an
unusual feeling about him.

107
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,122
I hear he doesn't talk much about himself.

108
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,224
Earlier, there was this 2nd-year girl...

109
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:35,227
...who after declaring herself,
tried to embrace him.

110
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:39,565
He thrust her away as hard as he
could, and looked terrified himself.

111
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,235
Odd for a student to do these days.

112
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,237
T- thank you very much.

113
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,905
Tohru, do you have work today?

114
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:48,574
Yes, I do.

115
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:53,245
That's rough. You're still staying with
your grandpa on your dad's side, right?

116
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,913
Y- yes...

117
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:58,584
You promised you'd pay your
own tuition, didn't you?

118
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,585
Y- yes.

119
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,587
Still,

120
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,023
since this is a prefecture-run school,

121
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:08,260
I wouldn't think you would have to
work so much just to cover tuition.

122
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,595
W- well, it's...

123
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,298
You're getting him to
feed you decent, right?

124
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,601
You're not getting swindled out of
everything from your paycheck, right?

125
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,602
R- right...

126
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,073
Really? Fine, then. If anything like
that happens, tell me right away.

127
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,541
I'll see that they don't get away with it.

128
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,876
O- okay.

129
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,711
<i>I couldn't tell them.</i>

130
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,881
<i>I couldn't tell Uo-chan and</i>
<i>Hana-chan that I was living in a tent.</i>

131
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,552
<i>--Tohru, Mama sure would</i>
<i>like some Sukiyaki today.</i>
<i>--My mother, who worked and worked</i>
<i>after my father passed away</i>

132
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,087
Family Budget
<i>in order to support us...</i>

133
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:40,893
<i>--Hooray! Meat, meat!</i>
<i>--My mother, who was always</i>
<i>so powerful and cheerful...</i>

134
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:45,564
<i>I never would have thought</i>
<i>she would die in an accident.</i>

135
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:49,234
<i>There was some amount of squabbling</i>
<i>over who would take care of me...</i>

136
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:52,905
<i>But in the end, it was decided I would</i>
<i>go to the house of my grandfather,</i>

137
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,573
<i>on my father's side.</i>

138
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,210
<i>I promised to pay my own tuition, so</i>
<i>as not to be a burden to my grandfather,</i>

139
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,247
<i>who was living on a pension.</i>

140
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,950
That was in May.
Four months later...
<i>However, Grandfather</i>
<i>came to live together</i>

141
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,485
<i>with his daughter and her husband,</i>

142
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,254
<i>and as it happened, their</i>
<i>house needed remodeling.</i>

143
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:14,593
<i>I was asked if I could stay with one of</i>
<i>my friends or something during that time.</i>

144
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:18,230
<i>Uo-chan lives in a one-room apartment,</i>

145
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,200
<i>and there are five people</i>
<i>in Hana-chan's family.</i>

146
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,869
<i>I couldn't very well make</i>
<i>trouble for them. However...</i>

147
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:24,870
<i>I've got it!</i>

148
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,606
I was going to live by
myself at some point
<i>I was going to live by</i>
<i>myself at some point.</i>

149
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,598
<i>This will be a good chance!</i>

150
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:38,217
Sohma-<i>kun</i>, about this
morning, I beg your pardon.

151
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:42,888
The same goes even more for me.
Shigure must have given you trouble.

152
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:50,896
No, he is a very fine person. He let
me see his ornaments of the zodiac.

153
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:54,566
You said something about being of
the year of the Cat, didn't you?

154
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,570
I was a bit off-kilter as a child.

155
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,904
Cats are fools. They have a bad nature.

156
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,916
Honda-<i>san</i>, did you know...

157
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:15,254
...that the zodiac is really part of a
timekeeping system of tens and twelves?

158
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,257
N- no...

159
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:22,327
Originally, they were used
as numerals, or as timepieces.

160
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:26,465
Afterward, they got adopted into
Yin-yang cosmology and divination,

161
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,201
and they were used in fortune-telling.

162
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,204
Did the animals have
anything to do with it?

163
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:38,243
Mm-mm. Apparently, it's not clearly known
at what time animals were adapted in,

164
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,546
or what source they
were established from,

165
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,281
but since the beginning,

166
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:47,413
there was never a time when the
Cat was a member of the zodiac.

167
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,123
Still, since it has come to
be associated with the zodiac,

168
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,958
whatever they say goes.

169
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,561
Cats really are fools, you know.

170
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:01,057
So, in short, Sohma-<i>kun</i>, do you hate cats?

171
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,512
I was thinking this morning, as well,
that your color doesn't look too good.

172
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,914
You should take better care of yourself.

173
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,383
Well, see you tomorrow.

174
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,855
<i>He really is mysterious.</i>

175
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:27,993
<i>Even so, Sohma-kun, I'll</i>
<i>pretend I didn't hear that.</i>

176
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:32,197
<i>I'm sure Mother had it much, much harder!</i>

177
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:34,867
Ladies, hurry and take
care of this garbage here!

178
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,201
Okay!

179
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:39,933
<i>I can't get discouraged!"Never give up!"</i>

180
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,545
I'm getting tired of eating
out every day like this.

181
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,881
Well, Shigure, cook something.

182
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,883
When I cook, you complain, don't you?

183
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:56,221
If there are pickled radishes in my curry,
you bet I want to complain a little.

184
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,123
Yuki-<i>kun</i>, you're a smart one,

185
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,225
but you're completely hopeless when
it comes to housework in general.

186
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:03,562
Say, how about we hire a housekeeper?

187
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,899
A woman would be trouble.

188
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,567
Huh?

189
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,229
Honda-<i>san...</i>

190
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,239
I'm home, mother.

191
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:20,245
I'm sleepy, but I still have
to do these printouts today.

192
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:24,114
I'll go wash my face in
the water of the stream.

193
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,788
Shigure, you're laughing too much.

194
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,605
I see. So that's why
you're living in a tent.

195
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,606
Yes...

196
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,941
Since when?

197
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,276
Since one week ago.

198
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,545
I thought it was strange.

199
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,949
This whole area is Sohma land, and
none of it has been leased or sold.

200
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,620
Um, if you would, please let
me borrow that spot temporarily.

201
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,956
Once the remodeling is complete,
I will leave immediately.

202
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,625
I don't have much money,
but I will pay you.

203
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,960
Please.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,594
It's dangerous over there.

205
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:12,431
The dirt in those cliffs is loose,
and every once in a while,
molesters may come around.

206
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,733
And it's unreasonable to have
a girl spend so many months

207
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,301
living in a tent in
the first place, isn't it?

208
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,302
Are you finished laughing?

209
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,303
Mm-hm.

210
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,806
It's all right!
I've gotten used to the slugs,

211
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,241
and I have plenty of stamina and drive...

212
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,242
Honda-<i>san</i>!

213
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,577
She has a fever.

214
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,307
Let's see... Ice, ice!

215
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,584
I- it's the Sea of Corruption...

216
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,576
That's a good analogy!

217
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:45,197
There. Just now, it appears
there was a landslide somewhere.

218
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:49,601
U- um, how can you tell?

219
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,938
Something of an intuition
of the wild, I suppose.

220
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,272
Is it nearby?

221
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:58,676
Close to the tent... or maybe not!

222
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,215
This is terrible! Mother was...

223
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,283
There was a picture of
Mother inside the tent!

224
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,285
Mother!

225
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:10,622
Honda-<i>san</i>, calm down. You have a fever.

226
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,291
But, Mother is...

227
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:18,964
What should I do? If I don't get her out
of there quickly, Mother will suffer...

228
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,700
Once it gets brighter,
we'll come here again.

229
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,669
If a second calamity was
to occur and you got hurt,

230
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,239
it would hurt your mother even more.

231
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,263
Okay?

232
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:37,916
Yuki-<i>kun</i> is looking for some ice now.

233
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,918
You'll have to excuse me.

234
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:43,719
It's probably exhaustion.
The strain on you could be piling up.

235
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:51,263
I've lost my home again...

236
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,931
Is that hard on you?

237
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,599
No...

238
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:59,938
I know something that's even harder...

239
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,607
What's that?

240
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:08,280
I didn't say... "Come back soon."

241
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,344
The morning of the day
Mother died in the accident.

242
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:25,564
I had a short test... so I studied into
the morning... and then couldn't get up.

243
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:33,572
It was only that morning that I didn't
say it... even though I always said it...

244
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:39,239
It was only that morning...

245
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:49,921
I... didn't want to go to high school...
I thought instead I would work...

246
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,924
However, Mother said...

247
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:56,261
<i>I only graduated from</i>
<i>middle school myself.</i>

248
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,029
<i>But I still would have liked to see</i>

249
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,931
<i>what being a high school</i>
<i>girl is like, you know?</i>

250
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:04,767
<i>That's why you're going to enjoy</i>
<i>the high school life in my place.</i>

251
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:16,306
I understood... that all that
time, she was working for me...

252
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:24,222
And yet, I couldn't say
"Come back soon" to Mother.

253
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:30,321
I wasn't even able to see
her back as she left to work.

254
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:37,569
And so, I want to at least...

255
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:47,568
I want to safely graduate from high
school, which Mother wanted me to attend.

256
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:53,181
That is my... goal...

257
00:15:54,586 --> 00:16:03,985
This is... no time...
to be outdone by... a fever...

258
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,599
Terrific, huh?

259
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,245
At school, she always seems so cheerful.

260
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:27,219
It seemed like she had never known
hardship or anything of the sort.

261
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:32,324
I had planned on running
away from the House of Sohma...

262
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,523
but in the end, here I am,
still among the Sohma...

263
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,199
If I really didn't like it,

264
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,902
I could have done like Honda-<i>san,</i>
and carried away a tent,

265
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,238
and gone off to either
somewhere unexplored,

266
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,573
or to the back country, or someplace.

267
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:52,911
I've had it easy, huh?

268
00:16:52,911 --> 00:17:00,418
It would be rude to
Tohru-<i>kun</i> to call it terrific.

269
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,911
You're right.

270
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,927
Can I leave her up to you?
I'm going to go out.

271
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,263
Where to?

272
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:16,301
Don't tell me you're going to go dig
that stuff out. Should I go with you?

273
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,602
It'll be tough all alone, right?

274
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,872
Alone?

275
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:24,365
Who do you think you're talking to?

276
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,205
Come back soon.

277
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,717
<i>Tohru...</i>

278
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,561
<i>Tohru?</i>

279
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,765
<i>You've gotten a fever again.</i>

280
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:51,294
<i>There's no need for you to</i>
<i>overdo it helping with the housework.</i>

281
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:57,342
<i>Tohru, you can just be yourself,</i>
<i>and take things slowly.</i>

282
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,578
<i>You'll overtake them sometime.</i>

283
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,206
<i>But...</i>

284
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,386
<i>Tohru, be yourself...</i>

285
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,061
Mother...

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,201
How come...

287
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:26,871
Morning!

288
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:30,875
How are you feeling?

289
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:35,472
I think I was able to dig out all of
your belongings. Could you check them?

290
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,218
Sohma-<i>kun</i>, did you go through
all that dirt by yourself?

291
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,554
Don't be silly!

292
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,223
Then, how did you...?

293
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,893
It's a secret.

294
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:52,230
It's a dirty house, and all...

295
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,600
...and there are only guys here,
but right there on the second floor,

296
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,569
there is one room available.

297
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,907
Until the remodeling is finished,
you can stay in this house.

298
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,909
T- that won't do! I must object to that!

299
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,244
The room does have a lock on it.

300
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,246
That's not what I meant!
How shall I say this...?

301
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,915
Tohru-<i>kun</i>, do you like housework?

302
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:13,918
For example, cleaning,
and cooking, and so on?

303
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,588
Um... yes, I do like that.

304
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,591
Welcome to the House of Sohma!

305
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,393
I'll carry your things up too.

306
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,528
Ah, Yuki-<i>kun</i>, let her
borrow a change of clothes.

307
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:26,865
Y- you can't! Not only did you tend
to me, you're giving me a room now?

308
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,533
I'm putting you to too much trouble!

309
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,803
Honda-san, we're suggesting
this because we want to,

310
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,539
so don't think you're being any
trouble, and take us up on it.

311
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,542
Besides, you have
nowhere else to go, right?

312
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,879
Right...

313
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,181
Um, in that case, if
I'm going to put you out,

314
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,682
then please tell me
about whatever rules

315
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,885
and customs the House of
Sohma has, and everything-

316
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,888
Don't worry about that sort of thing.

317
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:58,422
Honda-<i>san</i>, you can just be yourself,
and take things slowly... in this house.

318
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:06,905
<i>Tohru, you can just be yourself,</i>
<i>and take things slowly...</i>

319
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,575
So, are you sure this is okay?
Having a girl live together with us?

320
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,244
What's this? Up until now
you were utterly overjoyed.

321
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:19,918
It's all right. Just as long
as neither of us get hugged.

322
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,855
<i>Before I knew what was happening,</i>
<i>the matter had gone forward.</i>

323
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,191
<i>It feels like I'm having a dream.</i>

324
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,861
<i>But then again, I was</i>
<i>even borrowing clothes.</i>

325
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,198
Sure enough, because it's been
closed up, it has become moldy.

326
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,134
It would be best to open a
window for some ventilation.

327
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,542
Yo!

328
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,878
Are you ready for me to break your neck?

329
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,546
Prince of Rats...

330
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:50,882
Why don't you give it up already?

331
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,218
You're weak, after all.

332
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,221
Look, you! If you look on me as being
the same as I was just a while ago,

333
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,222
then you're in for some pain!

334
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,891
Today is the day when I smash
that egotistical nose of yours!

335
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,759
Please, wait a moment!

336
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:13,905
Yuki-<i>kun</i>, I just heard a terrific
noise. By any chance has Kyo come by?

337
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,575
Forgive me! Are you all right!?

338
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,878
Ah! He turned into a cat! A cat!
It's all because I bumped into him!

339
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,246
--No... um... look...
--Ah! He turned into a cat! A cat!
It's all because I bumped into him!

340
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,580
--No... um... look...
--I hit him wrong,
and turned him into a cat!

341
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,251
In any case, to the hospital!
We have to get him treated by a doctor!

342
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,810
--Honda-<i>san</i>!
--Tohru-<i>kun</i>!

343
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:50,641
<i>Mother, this is terrible!</i>
<i>Everyone is turning into animals!</i>

344
00:21:55,579 --> 00:22:05,578
<i>Now let us circle together,</i>
<i>around a pleasant dinner.</i>

345
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:15,588
<i>Come, take today's tears, and</i>
<i>make them tomorrow's strength.</i>

346
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,938
<i>La, la, la...</i>

347
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:27,944
<i>Wonderful love and life</i>

348
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:33,283
<i>La, la, la...</i>

349
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:38,955
<i>Adorable love and life</i>

350
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:44,294
<i>La, la, la...</i>

351
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:47,992
<i>Wonderful love and life</i>

352
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,829
On the next Fruits Basket
Episode 2...

353
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,331
Tohru-kun, what it come down to

354
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:24,967
is that I have the Dog,
Yuki-kun has the Rat,

355
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:30,439
and he has the spirit
of the Cat possesing him.

356
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:33,910
You were just intending to erase
Honda-san's memories anyway.

357
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,779
Like so long ago...

358
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:42,118
I will put my trust in this Tohru-san.

359
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:46,422
Or so I said... This really is awful...


360
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:47,822
Honda Tohru will do it!
